Concept Summary:  As recently highlighted by the White House Cancer Moonshot Forum on brain tumors, key challenges remain for harnessing the potential of personalized diagnosis and data-informed precision therapeutics and their on-going development on behalf of what is the leading cause of disease-related death in children. Accelerating the translation of biomedical research and enhanced computational resources such as artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) on behalf of empowered, democratized diagnostics, decision support frameworks, and novel clinical trials requires the implementation of scalable solutions that can address the rare disease setting of pediatric cancer.  Our proposed concept builds on our team’s broad-based federal cloud-based platform development and data coordination and distribution experience as well as our established multi-institutional pediatric networks and ongoing large language model technology deployment pilot efforts across local institutional resources that support multimodal data integration. We focus on the development and deployment of an extensible, actionable data commons framework supporting a national, federated data fabric empowered by novel data mesh technologies and an associated suite of leading edge cloud-based platforms, services, and artificial intelligence/machine-learning technologies that harness real world health and biomedical research data products standardization with integrated real-time multimodal data analytics. The concept leverages an established national network of academic research and clinical trial networks with existing master data use agreements and advances a technology empowered federated national biomedical research and learning health ecosystem. Although scoped to harness the innovation potential of a rare disease setting empowered by community engagement and partners, the proposal will further focus on establishing a framework of resilient systems that enable healthcare infrastructure to rapidly integrate biomedical knowledge sources and leverage real-time analytics on behalf of decision support tools while empowering distributed clinical trial resources and democratized access to care in a broadly extensible contexts.


Innovation and Impact: Despite their comparative individual diagnostic rarity, pediatric cancers remain the leading cause of disease-related death in children, with pediatric brain tumors as the most common and deadliest form.  Many pediatric brain tumors, like their more common adult glioblastoma counterpart, lack a curative standard of care with patients and clinicians often limited to what is temporary interventional life extension and more often palliative care.  Furthermore, especially in children, when traditional radiation and chemotherapeutic approaches succeed in preventing death, non-specific targeting of the developing nervous system can have long term harmful and debilitating effects that eliminate any chance for lifelong normalcy.  However, continued rapid biomedical technology sector growth and emerging computational and analytic advances have supported the ongoing development of diverse personalized treatment options for cancer that harness cross-domain, multimodal healthcare and biomedical-research-enabled target identification and empower decision support through analytic tools that are the harbingers of a generalizable personalized, precision therapeutics paradigm for both rare, pediatric cancers as well as adult patients with common cancers lacking curative standards of care.  


Likewise, while cancer prevention and proactive health efforts have largely focused on the aging adult setting, ongoing imaging and biomarker discovery technologies alongside emerging predictive analytics and computational frameworks that harness large language models via artificial intelligence and machine learning that are combined with the deployment of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) exchange standards are poised to advance the applied potential of multimodal, multi-sourced data for cancer prevention and early detection/diagnosis across both common and rare diseases spanning both the childhood and adult disease settings. Furthermore, increased recognition of the long-term and delayed effects of harmful or toxic environmental exposures and/or adverse health events in childhood (and even pre-birth) on lifelong health and disease is shifting the scope of cancer (and more broadly disease) prevention beyond traditional adult-based behavioral interventions and disease-specific screening to include a longitudinal, lifelong data-driven health view for individual health that begins at birth (if not conception).   


Despite such continued advances in therapeutic approaches and technologies to address cancer, participation in clinical trials in the adult setting remains low (>5%) and while, in contrast, clinical trial enrollment approaches 90% in many pediatric cancers, trial design methodologies and associated drug development and FDA approval frameworks are hampered by the rare disease setting of limited trial-ready cohorts and prolonged trial completion timelines in the traditional multi-arm study setting. Additionally, while our own diverse academic and commercial stakeholder team has supported both private and federally-sponsored, large-scale data generation, aggregation, analysis, and distribution efforts, and while analytic methods, tools, platforms, and cloud-based storage and computational technologies have provided for scaled and sustainable acceleration of increasingly FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible) data, the promise of operationalizing biomedical research and real world healthcare data resources and their rapid analysis and integration via a national, digitally empowered health learning ecosystem advancing broadly accessible patient-centered decision support and personalized care, diagnostics, and innovative clinical trial design frameworks has yet to be fulfilled in ways ARPA-H is uniquely positioned to disrupt and transform via the proposed concept and its broad applicability and long-term national impact.


Proposed Work: Our proposed implementation will harness the actionable potential of non-local, democratized data-driven discovery and decision support while simultaneously empowering multi-stakeholder engagement and platform iterations (clinicians, researchers, and patients) across the healthcare ecosystem to connect, advance, and more rapidly innovate on the implementation of multimodal data mesh technologies that support asynchronous, non-local, and multi-system data curation, analysis, and integration. Our concept focuses on both structured and unstructured data derived from real-world electronic health record data sources, the clinical trial setting, and large-scale biomedical research data sets.  Our proposed solutions harness a federated multi-institutional health system data fabric deployment empowered by data mesh technologies and cloud-based platforms supporting multimodal data products, scaled analytics, robust governance frameworks, and empowered accessibility and use of real-time data products. Importantly, our proposed implementations seek to harness a combination of academic, federal, and commercial resources and their integration to iteratively address the requirements posed by a complex set of social-political-technical-economic barriers that underpin the status quo of biomedical research and health data disempowerment by and large defined by institutional data silos; data fragmentation; a lack of data interoperability; an absence of shared data security standards, governance models and legal congruence; inequality in institutional resources and expertise; and historically limited institutional incentives for broad data sharing and data empowerment despite patient community engagement and emerging national institute of health and office of national coordinator mandates.

In order to advance a national data fabric solution for an integrated biomedical research and a federated learning health ecosystem, we propose to advance a novel technology stack solution that builds on our team’s joint experience and demonstrated capacity to support multimodal data operations, integration and scaled cloud-based computation.  Through federally supported AWS STRIDES-hosted platforms across NIH and NCI that include the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource, the INCLUDE (INvestigation of Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) Data Hub, the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE), NIH CARING for Children with COVID program, the Childhood Cancer Data Initiative and NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud, the NHLBI BioData Catalyst, and the NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability (NCPI) effort our team has supported the large scale deployment of cloud-based portals and platforms enabling multimodal data aggregation, harmonization, integration and analysis spanning FHIR-enabled real world data sources that include medical imaging, histopathology, and electronic healthcare records, clinical trial datasets, and large-scale, sample-based ‘omics datasets representing the largest publicly hosted multimodal pediatric cancer and rare-disease cohorts of their kind. Such efforts have been paired with the establishment of multi-institutional patient-consented research biosample collection and processing, longitudinal observational trials, and early-phase clinical trials through the Children’s Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) and Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC), representing >40 leading pediatric hospitals with established master agreements for comprehensive electronic record and multimodal clinical data sharing.  Together, these networks have supported the sample-based data generation and clinical data curation of the largest pediatric brain tumor cohort of its kind currently hosted by the NIH Kids First Data Resource and NCI CCDI-associated platforms.  These efforts are further integrated into the Cancer Moonshot and ongoing initiatives with the FDA to advance the use of external controls for novel clinical trial designs for pediatric brain tumors. 


In order to shift and extend the paradigm from platform enabled point in time cohorts as currently supported by NIH systems to a scalable solution for resilient systems that empower a real-time national data fabric, we propose to extend, integrate, and advance our deployments of user-facing portals and dashboards, the CAVATICA (CHOP-Velsera) and Flywheel platforms, and AWS supported data mesh technologies that harness FHIR standards to the institutional/hospital interface as a federated architecture for the integration of real-world clinical data and biomedical research datasets.  Data mesh deployments will support real-time data product publishing from institutional electronic health records, Radiology Information Systems (RIS) and Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), Pathology and Clinical Genomic Information Systems, and Laboratory Information Systems (LIS) and provide for their ongoing integration and analysis with hosted biomedical research data resources.  The solutions will harness FISMA and FedRAMP moderate deployments that provide strong protection for controlled and private data and enable efficient broad platform interoperability through the use of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Data Repository Service (DRS).  Furthermore, we will advance the new deployments of AWS- and Nvidia- hosted generative AI solutions that harness the application of ensemble large language models for the empowered use and integration of structured and unstructured multimodal and FHIR-structured clinical data, providing for first-in kind developments of real-time queries and use of multimodal data by a diverse healthcare and research community spanning clinicians, researchers, and ultimately patients.  
Why now? While our proposed technical solutions harness recently developed leading edge technologies poised for translation, their implementation in the setting of a national data fabric comes at a unique socio-technical crossroads of technology and new health data policies and standards over the past two years spanning a combination of newly implemented national healthcare data requirements and standards for covered entities and new FDA guidelines and drug approval requirements with transformative potential for pediatric cancers as well as many other indications.  They include (1) the use of FHIR as a required standard for data exchange and its incorporation into ONC’s recently advanced Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) in its fulfillment of 21st Century Cures Act requirements; (2) the associated emerging Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs) framework for interoperable data exchange; (3) the implementation of healthcare information blocking policies under the Cure’s Act Final Rule; (4) the FDA’s guidance framework for the use of real-world data for external control arms in the setting of rare disease population; and in oncology (5) the implementation of the RACE act requiring all new adult oncology therapeutics under consideration for approval by the FDA to be evaluated for safety and efficacy in pediatric cancers if the treatment is directed at a molecular target relevant to pediatric cancer, including therapeutics with an orphan drug designation. Together, these represent transformational and unprecedented socio-technical policy and regulatory opportunities that are poised to dramatically empower our proposed technical solutions architecture for a federated, national data fabric framework.
